## CONTEXT (Authoritative inputs for this task)

Read and consider as authoritative:
- AGENTS.md
- rules-*.yaml (stack rules)
- specs/spec.yml (if present)
- Relevant source files
- Any additional context explicitly provided by the user

Authoritative order: user instructions > AGENTS.md > rules-*.yaml > specs > code/tests > memories/hints. Treat IDE/tool memories as hints; verify before acting and flag anything that looks stale or conflicting.

Do not assume missing requirements.
Use IDE or tool memories only as hints. All decisions must be validated against AGENTS.md, rules files, and specs.
